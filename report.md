(This can take my [article](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/MYI2JPmDu9AAD-FhVAQYFg). I write all my feeling in it. I do not know it is OK to you. If donâ€™t, I will rewrite it to you)



**3. How do you feel about studying this programme? What attracts you the most?** 

This programme takes both ICS and EST courses but not completely. There has many vacancies in the CS and EE area. PPTs and courses are not enough. Therefore, it inspired me to learning more to fill up my curiosity. I learnt many from googling stuff, stackoverflow and many collages open course, which from my first year to now.

It is because of these vacancies that I understand that I have to keep exploring and learning on my own in order to have growth. Classroom-based education still has great limitations, and the most important thing is to keep exploring. That is the most thing attracts me.
